We're also Santa Claus!
Ooh, name it after me! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. You're going to do his laundry? Please, Don-Botâ€¦ look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.

Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.
A sexy mistake. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Take me to your leader! Look, last night was a mistake. I'm a thing.

I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
Who are you, my warranty?!
Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? You are the last hope of the universe. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.
Oh God, what have I done?
Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?
Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Tell her she looks thin.

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.

I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

With gusto. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Can I use the gun? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! And I'm his friend Jesus.

You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Throw her in the brig. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? But existing is basically all I do!

We're rescuing ya. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Oh sure! Blame the wizards! I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.

This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? No! The cat shelter's on to me. It's a T. It goes "tuh". This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

Tell her she looks thin. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.

I'm a thing. Actually, that's still true. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
