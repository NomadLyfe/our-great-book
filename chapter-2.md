Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!
In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. No. We're on the top. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… They're like sex, except I'm having them! Kif might!

That's not soon enough!
I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!
Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.
That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?
You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.
Ooh, name it after me!
You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? It must be wonderful. When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

When will that be? Bender, we're trying our best. I had more, but you go ahead. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!

Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. No! The cat shelter's on to me.

For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

Bender, we're trying our best. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Tell her she looks thin. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Then we'll go with that data file! I can explain. It's very valuable. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

Belligerent and numerous. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. No, I'm Santa Claus! With gusto.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Also Zoidberg. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Why would a robot need to drink?
